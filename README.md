Welcome to the **PySparkTutorial** repository!
This repository is a comprehensive guide to mastering PySpark through hands-on tutorials and examples.
Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of PySpark, this resource has something for everyone.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Remote - Containers extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Snippets Repository**

First, clone the repository containing the code to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gvatsal60/PySparkTutorial.git
```

### 2. **Open the Directory in VSCode:**

- Open the current directory in VS Code.
- Press `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
- Search for and select **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**.

### 3. **Wait for the Setup:**

- VS Code will build the dev container image (if required) and start the container.
- Once completed, youâ€™ll be inside the dev container environment.

### 4. **Start Working:**

- Now you can develop in the isolated and pre-configured **PySpark** container environment.
